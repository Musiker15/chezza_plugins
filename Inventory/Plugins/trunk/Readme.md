#### Hey guys,
I edited the trunk plugin and added custom trunk weights to it.

**Only Inventory V3**

#### Installation
* Replace the `trunk.lua` in folder `client/plugins/`
* Go to `config.lua` and add the following at the bottom

```lua
Config.TrunkCustomWeights = {
    ["zentorno"] = 15,
    ["adder"] = 15,
}
```

##### Have fun :)

Regards
