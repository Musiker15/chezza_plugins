## Good to know
* With Inventory v3 you can only buy items or weapons but you can't sell them.

## Installation
* Replace the `fxmanifest.lua`.
* Replace the `shop.lua` in folder `/client/plugins/`.
* Replace the `main.lua` in folder `/server/`.
* Upload `config_shops.lua` to the root folder *(where the `config.lua` is located)*.

Now please restart the inventory and have fun :)
