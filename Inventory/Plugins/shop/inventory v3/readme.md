## Good to know
* With Inventory v3 you can only buy items or weapons but you can't sell them.

## Installation
Step 1: Replace the `fxmanifest.lua`.
Step 2: Replace the `shop.lua` in folder `/client/plugins/`.
Step 3: Replace the `main.lua` in folder `/server/`.
Step 4: Upload `config_shops.lua` to the root folder *(where the `config.lua` is located)*.

Now please restart the inventory and have fun :)
